ABSTRACT:
The calculator app in Python is a basic program that enables users to perform simple arithmetic operations. The app provides an interface that allows users to enter numerical values and perform calculations using operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator app is built using Python's Tkinter library, which provides a user-friendly graphical interface for the application.The program is designed to be easy to use, with intuitive buttons and a display screen that shows the user's input and output. The app can handle a wide range of numerical values and is equipped with error handling mechanisms to prevent crashes and incorrect calculations. The app can also be customized with additional features and functions to enhance its functionality. Overall, the calculator app in Python is a simple and efficient program that provides users with an essential tool for performing basic calculations. It serves as a foundation for more complex mathematical programs and can be a useful tool for students, professionals, and anyone in need of quick and accurate calculations.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
The problem that the calculator in Python project aims to solve is to provide a basic tool for performing simple arithmetic calculations. The traditional approach to performing calculations involves the use of a physical calculator or manual computation. However, these methods can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with complex calculations.The calculator in Python project seeks to provide an efficient and accurate alternative to traditional methods. The calculator app is designed to be userfriendly, with intuitive buttons and a display screen that shows the user's input and output. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
STEPS TO BUILD A CALULATOR APP IN PYTHON:
* Choose a GUI toolkit
* Design the user interface
* Write the code for the user interface
* Write the code for the calculator's operations
* Connect the buttons to the operations
* Test the calculator
